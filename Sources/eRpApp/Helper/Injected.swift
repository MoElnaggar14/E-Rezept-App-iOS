/// Use this property wrapper to  inject dependencies from a type conforming to the `AppContainerType` protocol.
/// Dependencies are resolved by passing a related `keyPath` for the service
///
/// To use `Injected` you provide a dependency injection container that should be used for the injection,
/// followed by the `keyPath` to the service to be inject, a name and the type of the service:
///
/// 	@Injected(container: YourDIContainer(), \.userStore) var userDefaultsStore: UserDataStore
///
/// If you omitted the dependency injection container the default container will be used
